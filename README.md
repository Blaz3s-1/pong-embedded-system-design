# PONG using IR control

This is not a published version of this game or mass producing anyhow, so please refrain from being too exciting about it

Library nessacary to install in order to run the game: <ul>
<li>IRremote.h</li>
<li>Adafruit_SSD1306.h</li>
<li>Adafruit_GFX.h</li>
<li>Wire.h</li>
</ul>

This is supposed to be a documentation of the above, though to be honest I don't really know what to write beyond this part
